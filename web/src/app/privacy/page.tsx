      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        We value your privacy. This website is designed to work with minimal data. We do not run tracking scripts or
        analytics. We do not sell products and we do not run user accounts.
      </p>
      <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        We use only strictly necessary technologies to provide the service. Specifically, we use local storage in your
        browser to remember the following settings on your device:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Theme and agent selection (for styling and shop routing)</li>
        <li>Your favorites (so items remain bookmarked)</li>
        <li>Local click counters (to sort by popularity locally)</li>
        <li>Optional image consent for brand‑related images (so you do not have to confirm each time)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These values never leave your device unless you explicitly share them. You can delete them at any time via your
        browser settings (clear site data) or by using your browser’s private mode.
      </p>
      <h2>Server Logs</h2>
      <p>
        Our server may process minimal technical data required to deliver the site (e.g., IP address in HTTP requests)
        and respond to API requests. We do not build profiles. Caching headers may be used to improve performance.
      </p>
      <h2>Third‑Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Links lead to external purchasing agents and marketplaces (e.g., Superbuy, MuleBuy, AllChinaBuy, CNFans,
        iTaobuy, Taobao, Weidian). We are not affiliated with these parties and have no control over their content or
        processing. Please review their respective privacy policies before using their services.
      </p>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
